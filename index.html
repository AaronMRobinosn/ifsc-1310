  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflections</h2>
    <p>I have enjoyed participating in Web Technologies this semester. The assignments were challenging and contained relevant information to what we were learning. A few of the assignments were difficult to complete due to updates in the software we were using. The Gravit logo design was one of those challenging assignments that required me to go beyond the tutorial to complete it. </p>
    <p>There are a few things I could have done better for this course. One of the main things I struggle with personally is asking for help from my professors. I must do the bulk of the work of course, but there were times I wanted to add more to my assignments and webpages that were dropped do to bugs. Expanding my designs above what was learned in class was something else I could have done better. Many of the webpages I visit daily contain simple features that make the things more accessible and eye catching. These features could have been added to my assignments with some extra work.</p>
    <p>The final project for this Web Technology class was both exciting and difficult. The most exciting part of this project was creating the theme. On the real SpaceX website, I noticed that the background colors for most of sections were black. If black was not used it was because the section was comprised of an image with color. From the research I decided to go with a dark theme for my layout with mostly white font.</p>
    <p>Most of the problems I ran into while completing the project was optimizing images for the webpages. The SpaceX logo needed the most work. The logo was initially too big to fit in the container made for the banner. My initial solution was to resize the logo in the Paint 3D application on my computer. This solution worked, but it lowered the quality of the image. The second solution was to resize the original file in the work environment. This took a few iterations of trial and error to condense the logo to the correct amount of pixels. If the logo was too small, it would repeat in the container and if it was too big portions of it would not be displayed. The logo was able to fit perfectly after implementing this solution.</p>
    <p>The second part of the project was to get feedback from another person. I chose to get feedback from my parents. The feedback received was mostly making the text more visible. My initial project used a linear gradient for the background of all the content sections. The gradient went from black to a steel blue. The steel blue was to light for white font. I changed the steel blue to a darker blue to fix this problem. Another change that they wanted to see was all uppercase titles. I added text transform uppercase to all the headers in my CSS. Some final adjustments were changing title fonts and adding some color to the header of the table in the About page.</p>

  <h2>Progressive Development</h2>
  <p>
   Progressive Enhancement is a method that a web designer should follow when designing a website. The method requires that a designer begins their work on the content or HTML of the website, then proceed to add more complex designs and functions with CSS and JavaScript. The goal is to create code that can be any browser or device. </p>
    <p>As technology progresses, the internet has only added more types of Browsers to access its information. These browsers are unique in how they interact with a website’s code and not all functionality is present in each browser. Applying progressive enhancement to one’s code is necessary for a designers reach and a user’s web accessibility.</p>
