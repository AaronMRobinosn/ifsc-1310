       Progressive Enhancement is a method that a web designer should follow when designing a website. The method requires that a designer begins their work on the content or HTML of the website, then proceed to add more complex designs and functions with CSS and JavaScript. The goal is to create code that can be any browser or device.

    <p>As technology progresses, the internet has only added more types of Browsers to access its information. These browsers are unique in how they interact with a website’s code and not all functionality is present in each browser. Applying progressive enhancement to one’s code is necessary for a designers reach and a user’s web accessibility.</p>
